Emerald Skies is a weather app using Dark Sky's forecast API. When the app is initially opened, the device's current location is acquired and a request to the Dark Sky API is made to fetch the current and future weather conditions. While Dark Sky provides an abundance of data such as the weather summary, precipitation odds, and humidity, only some of this info is displayed within the UI.
